## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM Metodology
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to connect imput with labels and how to use the checked attribute in javaScript.

I used this line of code 
```js
  document.querySelector('input[name="rating"]:checked').value
```
this helps me to know if any imput was selected without having to check all the imput separately so I can move to the next view. 

### Useful resources
